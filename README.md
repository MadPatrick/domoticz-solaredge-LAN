# Domoticz SolarEdge_ModbusTCP plugin

A Domoticz plugin to collect data from SolarEdge power inverters over ModbusTCP.

The plugin uses the `solaredge_modbus` library (<https://github.com/nmakel/solaredge_modbus>) to communicate with the inverter.

## Requirements

The inverter needs to be connected to the network (either wired or wireless) and Modbus must be enabled on the device. Please consult the documentation of your inverter to find out how to enable Modbus.

## Installation of the plugin

### Domoticz running on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

Install `pip3`:

``` shell
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Install `domoticz`:

``` shell
curl -sSL install.domoticz.com | sudo bash
```

Make sure that the `plugins` folder exists in the `domoticz` folder.

Install the plugin:

``` shell
cd domoticz/plugins
git clone https://github.com/addiejanssen/domoticz-solaredge-modbustcp-plugin.git
```

Go to the plugin folder and install all required addons:

``` shell
cd domoticz/plugins/domoticz-solaredge-modbustcp-plugin
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Once that is done, restart domoticz:

``` shell
sudo service domoticz.sh restart
```

### Domoticz running inside Docker

Please have a look at the Domoticz documentation before going this route: https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Docker

This guide is based on the information of the original Domoticz Docker image, which can be found here: https://hub.docker.com/r/domoticz/domoticz

The installation documentation states:
> When launching the docker container for the first time, a plugin folder is created in the userdata folder. You need to place your python plugins is folder.

You will need to start Domoticz once to create the data in that userdata folder.
Once the folder is initialize, we can add the plugin.

Install the plugin:

``` shell
cd <path for config files>/plugins
git clone https://github.com/addiejanssen/domoticz-solaredge-modbustcp-plugin.git
```

There are multiple ways to install the modules that are required by this plugin.
This is the _easy going_ option, but it may not be the best solution for the long run:

Connect to the running container

``` shell
docker exec -it domoticz
```

Go to the plugin folder and install all required addons:

``` shell
cd userdata/plugins/domoticz-solaredge-modbustcp-plugin
pip3 install -r requirements.txt -t .
```

Once that is done, restart the domoticz container.

## Configuration in Domoticz

Once the plugin is installed, a new hardware type will be available: `SolarEdge ModbusTCP`.

To add the inverter, go to `Setup` -> `Hardware` and add the inverter:

- Enter a `name` for the inverter.
- Select `SolarEdge ModbusTCP` from the `type` dropdown list.
- Enter the IP address of the inverter in the `Inverter IP Address` field.
- Enter the port number (default: 502) of the inverter in the `Inverter Port Number` field.
- Select `Yes` in the `Add missing devices` to create the devices when the inverter is added. Select `No` after deleting unwanted devices. Leaving the option set to `Yes` will recreate the deleted devices once Domoticz is restarted.
- Select an `Interval` (default: 5 seconds); this defines how often the plugin will collect the data from the inverter. Short intervals will result in more accurate values and graphs, but also result in more network traffic and a higher workload for both Domoticz and the inverter.
- Optionally change the `Auto Avg/Max math`; this defaults to `Enabled` which means that the Domoticz graphs for most values will be averaged over time. When selecting `Disabled`, the calculations will be disabled and the Domoticz graphs will be based on the last retrieved value.
- Optionally change the `Log level`; this defaults to `Normal`. When selecting `Extra`, the plugin will print all the information it received from the inverter in the log. When selecting `Debug`, even more information will be logged.
- `Add` the inverter.

This should result in a lot of new devices in the `Setup` -> `Devices` menu.

## Updating the plugin

Go to the plugin folder and get the new version:

``` shell
cd domoticz/plugins/domoticz-solaredge-modbustcp-plugin
git pull
```

Once that is done, restart domoticz:

``` shell
sudo service domoticz.sh restart
```
